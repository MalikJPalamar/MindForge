## Core Components

### 1. Game Engine (`src/js/core/game.js`)
The main `MindForge` class orchestrates the entire application:
- **State Management**: Centralized game state with user progress, settings, and chamber data
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage with auto-save functionality
- **Chamber Management**: Dynamic loading and initialization of puzzle chambers
- **User Progression**: XP system, level progression, and unlock mechanics

### 2. Chamber System
Each chamber is a self-contained module with:
- **Puzzle Generation**: Dynamic puzzle creation with varying difficulty
- **Hint System**: Multi-level progressive hints
- **Educational Content**: Explanations and real-world applications
- **Progress Tracking**: Individual chamber progress and analytics

#### Implemented Chambers:

**Pattern Recognition** (`src/js/chambers/pattern-recognition.js`)
- Visual patterns (color, shape, rotation)
- Number sequences (arithmetic, geometric, Fibonacci)
- Shape patterns (growing, nested, symmetrical)
- 25 puzzles with progressive difficulty

**Logical Sequences** (`src/js/chambers/logical-sequences.js`)
- Basic logic (if-then, transitive reasoning)
- Conditional logic (complex conditions, nested statements)
- Advanced logic (syllogisms, modal logic, paradoxes)
- 25 puzzles covering fundamental logical reasoning

**Spatial Reasoning** (`src/js/chambers/spatial-reasoning.js`)
- 2D spatial transformations
- 3D visualization and mental rotation
- Advanced spatial concepts (topology, non-Euclidean geometry)
